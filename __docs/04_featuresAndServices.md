## Features and Services

In our experience, every business is different and every project has its own quirks and adventures. Deciding what exactly a new project is going to involve is too important a question to leave to canned pre-written responses. That's why our Kickoff Workshop is so important to us.

That said, there are many features and services that apply to most projects, and it's likely your new website build will involve several (if not all) of the following:

* Market Research
* Branding Design
* Content Strategy Design
* Information Architecture Design
* Responsive Web Design
* Performance and Speed Testing
* Accessibility Testing
* Comprehensive User Training

### Content Management System (CMS)
    The majority of modern website require some way for their owners to manage the content within the site. This functionality comes in the form of a Content Management System.

    We often recommend a system called Wordpress. WordPress is an industry leading open source CMS that provides the flexibility and speed required for most websites. At DWM we consider ourselves experts in Wordpress development.

    WordPress is an open source CMS and there is no annual license fee. It is easy to learn for content editors, and using it means that youâ€™re not tied to one development agency for future updates.

### SEO Baseline
    Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a complex field. In essence it breaks down into two main areas: the things you do when building the site, and the things you do to market the site.

    All our sites get what we call our SEO Baseline. All content is structured to meet best-practices and is standards-compliant. We pride ourselves on creating semantic markup that is tailored to be easily accessed and understood by search engines.

    We do all the "building" SEO by default, but any "marketing" work is usually an add-on. When necessary, we recommend working in tandem with an external PR or SEO company. There are a lot of little subtleties and "gotchas" with SEO, and every project has its own specific SEO goals and targets.

### e-Commerce
    A one-size-fits-all approach to e-commerce never leads to good results. If an online shop is part of your project, we'll tailor a solution to fit your specific needs and requirements.

    Many of our clients find that Wordpress is the best CMS for their needs, in which case we often use an e-commerce system called WooCommerce as a starting point. WooCommerce is designed specifically to integrate with Wordpress, and provides a seamless experience for website visitors and administrators alike.

    Sometimes a more involved approach is required, however, and we have a number of options when building more complex bespoke online shops. Our own custom-developed system Jamva is often a good solution for those with more advanced e-commerce needs. And if even that is not enough, our team of programmers can build an entirely bespoke system from scratch.
