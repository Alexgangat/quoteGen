## The DWM Manifesto

Never before have consumers been more comfortable with technology, and never 
before have so many businesses completely overlooked such a massive opportunity. At DWM, we aim to change this. We work with businesses to ensure the internet is an asset to their company.

Design is about more than just the visuals, and technology is about more than just adding complexity. We see designing for the web as a kind of architecture; it defines how your customers move through your space, and how they feel as they do it. We see technology as an opportunity to make things simpler, not more complicated. 

At DWM we combine bespoke interaction design with cutting edge technological development. We make beautifully seamless experiences for your customers and staff.
