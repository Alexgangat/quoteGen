Dear Gavin,

Thanks for reaching out to us for your new project. This email outlines my perception of what the priorities should be when upgrading and improving the existing Composite Integration website.

I'm hoping this is in-line with the kind of project you're envisioning. If we're on the same page, the next step will be to send you some documents with more detail about our team and our working methods, and to schedule a meeting to really get the ball rolling.

As I see it, a rebuild of composite-integration.co.uk needs to cover four main areas:
1. Responsiveness.
2. Future-proofing.
3. Content Strategy and Information Architecture.
4. Visual Design and Branding.

1. Responsiveness

Your site needs to be accessible on a wide range of devices and screen sizes. Currently the layout is fixed, so only people viewing the pages on a desktop-sized screen are delivered the optimal experience. You're also not taking full advantage of the integrations that modern devices allow for.

Trends show many businesses see the majority of their traffic from "mobile" devices. Even if mobile traffic is low for you right now (which it most likely will be if mobile devices are not catered for by your site) we can guarantee it will represent an increasing percentage of your traffic in the coming months and years.

Since April 2015, Google searches on mobile devices now mark whether a site is "mobile friendly". The Google "mobile friendly" test must be passed, or search rankings will drop considerably in the coming months.

2. Future-proofing

With the desire to 'light a fire' under the Materials division, e-commerce is a future possibility. Any new system should be built in a way that makes adding on this kind of functionality later as easy as possible.

In future, giving the site a 'face-lift' should not mean having to re-build the entire system:
    - Tastes change and design trends evolve. Appearing "current" is often a marker of trustworthiness to new customers, so periodic updates to the style of a webpage are occasionally needed. Sometimes a site can continue un-tweaked for years and years, but in our experience most websites benefit from a cosmetic nip-and-tuck every two to three years.
    - Changing the visual elements does not have to mean changing the navigation and site-structure. Updates to the underlying architecture are required less frequently, and are more often triggered by wider business factors rather than just a desire to 'freshen' the site.

Ease of use for content managers:
    - The success of a web project often lies in continued work.
    - A frequently-updated site ranks better on search engines.
    - Frequently updated sites look better to customers. Old/outdated content triggers issues of trustworthiness and competency.
    - Being able to add/change content based on market factors can be a powerful tool, both for business development and marketing initiatives.
    - Adding and updating content should be as frictionless a process as possible for whoever is tasked with managing the site's content.

3. Content Strategy and Information Architecture

This is going to be the 'Big Win' for Composite Integration. Improving the responsiveness of your site and building a secure foundation for future improvements and maintenance are important, but they are both areas that *any* new web project needs to address. They'll better prepare your business for the digital future and prevent any catastrophes that a poor digital offering can often cause.

Having a solid content strategy, however, is a proactive investment in your business. It requires a thorough examination of several aspects:

- Who is your site for?
- What do *they* want from your site?
- What *you* want them to get from your site?

There can be many answers to those questions, and an advanced site can serve many purposes. Most businesses have content aimed at existing customers, but also have a funnel for drawing in new custom.

By identifying the four divisions you need your site to focus on, Composite Integration is clearly already thinking in this manner. The main task for this project will be to drill down what content needs to go into which section, and how best to present that content.

Your site already has a wealth of varied content, so we have a good base to work from. Presenting that information in a more engaging and easy-to-use, easy-to-digest fashion should be priority-one for the project.

Good site navigation can be the difference between a successful site and a failure, and it's an area many companies overlook. It's really refreshing to see a business like yours coming to us with 'navigation' already a top priority.

4. Visual Design and Branding

The essential Content Strategy and Information Architecture work can be done within existing brand guidelines, or as part of a complete visual makeover. Whatever the context, it will inevitably involve the use of design elements like icon sets, colour palates, and advanced typographic hierarchies. These are particularly powerful assets when breaking up a site into discrete sections, as Composite Integration are looking to do with their four divisions.

Do you have set brand guidelines you'd like us to work within? You mentioned in your email and on the phone that you were looking to replace the banner imagery. Do you have existing visual design work to be incorporated, and do you have a design team working on them already? Or is that something you'd be looking to DWM to provide?

If you have any questions about these areas, or if you think I've missed any important aspects, drop me an email. Browsing your site and reading more about your business, this feels like it has the makings of a promising partnership. 

The sooner we talk about budget the better, too. Commissioning a web project is very much like buying a car. If you're looking for a reliable little run-around and we're pitching you an executive saloon we'll soon run into problems (and vica-versa). Do you have a specific budget in mind? DWM offer a wide range of features and specifications, so we can provide solutions to fit most budgets.

This is, of course, the start of a discussion, and as a specific feature-set emerges we'll be able to offer you solid numbers to work with.

Regards, and thanks again for getting in touch,
Tom Hazledine.
