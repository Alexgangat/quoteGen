## Our Process

What DWM will *not* do is take a brief and then disappear for months, only returning for a Big Reveal&trade; at the end of the project. We take an agile approach to managing projects; dealing with *features* in short sprints, testing and reviewing, and then refining. Test, Measure, Learn.

To be sure of delivering a successful end-product, we need to break the site down into sections. These sections should be deliverable features that can be built quickly and tested early.

### Kickoff Workshop

One of the most important stages in any DWM project is our Kickoff Workshop. This is where we identify all the opportunities and obstacles that lie between us and the completed project. It's also where we confirm the exact feature-set your project needs. 

The workshops are always very revealing, inspiring, and often (dare we say it) fun. You'll learn a lot about the upcoming process, and maybe even learn some things about your own business.

The main take-away from our Kickoff Workshop is a breakdown of the project's Sprints. At DWM we work in Sprints: mini projects-within-projects that each have one clear goal and one clear deliverable.

> Our Kickoff Workshops have proved to be so useful that we also offer them as stand-alone consultancy sessions. We call them Discovery Days, and are available in half-day and full-day formats.

### The power of a sprint-based approach is twofold:

* #### The client sees regular progress.
    You can be a regular collaborator in the project. This ensures we stay on track, and that you get the site you really want.

* #### Testing happens sooner.
    User Experience issues are identified sooner, and can therefore be addressed more efficiently.
    
    All devices can be tested from the beginning.
    
    Accessibility concerns are addressed throughout the process, not as an afterthought.

### A typical project will most likely include the following Sprints:

* #### Styleguide Sprint: setting the tone.
    You website is going to be your public face in any number of situations, and in any number of formats. Determining a consistent look and feel – a genuine Brand – is an essential first-step. We'll take in your existing branding, any influences you might have, as well as our own experience and intuition, and we'll mix it altogether and come up with a killer look for your new project. 

* #### MVP Sprint: The Minimum Viable Product.
    The MVP represents the smallest amount of work we can do to get something in front of test users. Typically this is a content-based website that conforms to the brand guidelines and conveys the appropriate tone of voice.

* #### Feature Sprints
    Feature Sprints tackle specific areas of functionality. Need a blog, for instance? That's a Feature Sprint.
    
    We'd then build the necessary functionality (in the case of a blog: the ability for a site owner to log-in and create/manage/delete content, and for a site user to access/browse/search that content). The sprint ends when that feature ships, which means we can get it in front of testers and a small cohort of real users.

### Staying Flexible

Sometimes needs change, or ideas &mdash; once tested &mdash; just don't work. Sometimes alternative options present themselves out of the ether&hellip; Regular reviewing of the project's objectives and progress keeps things moving in the right direction.

Working in Sprints gives us this flexibility. It also allows us to get a working product in the hands of testers as early as possible. Catching issues early helps us stay on-budget and on-time. If we catch issues early, addressing them is much faster.
